Hi, I’m @dillonloh, a Singaporean who is currently working at Hiverlab Pte Ltd. in Singapore.  
I also do freelance backend development/data engineering work.
I have 3 years of work experience in data analytics, machine learning, and backend development.


# My Research Experience

**Nagoya University Galaxy Formation and Evolution Laboratory (Omega Lab)**

Did research on the use of various types of unsupervised machine learning methods/neural networks in analysing the link between the morphological and physical properties of galaxies.

- Poster presentation at the 9th East Asian Numerical Astrophysics Meeting held in Okinawa (September 26 - 30, 2022) [Poster here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p8KgDVcbgbj3gPB_b58x4WM6ZLkN1kal/view?usp=sharing)
- Short talk at the 4th Data Science in Astronomy Conference held at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo (October 3 - 5, 2022) [Slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eCxuSCMEshO7sUaviOSEWU8hxl2yHAMQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106418298605170918085&rtpof=true&sd=true)
