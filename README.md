Hi, I’m @dillonloh, a Singaporean who is currently working in Komaki-shi, Aichi-ken, Japan. 
I am currently a freelance backend developer at Hiverlab and Autonomous Robotics Researcher at OnClouds 株式会社.

My biggest interests lie in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data Engineering.

# My Research Experience

**Nagoya University Galaxy Formation and Evolution Laboratory (Omega Lab)**
Did research on the use of various types of unsupervised machine learning methods/neural networks in analysing the link between the morphological and physical properties of galaxies.

- Poster presentation at the 9th East Asian Numerical Astrophysics Meeting held in Okinawa (September 26 - 30, 2022)
- Short talk at the 4th Data Science in Astronomy Conference held at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo (October 3 - 5, 2022)
