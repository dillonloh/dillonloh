Hi, I’m @dillonloh, a Singaporean who is currently working at Nittera Co. Ltd. in Komaki-shi, Aichi-ken, Japan.  
I have 2 years of work experience in data analytics, machine learning, and backend development.

My biggest interests lie in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data Engineering.

# My Research Experience

**Nagoya University Galaxy Formation and Evolution Laboratory (Omega Lab)**

Did research on the use of various types of unsupervised machine learning methods/neural networks in analysing the link between the morphological and physical properties of galaxies.

- Poster presentation at the 9th East Asian Numerical Astrophysics Meeting held in Okinawa (September 26 - 30, 2022) [Poster here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p8KgDVcbgbj3gPB_b58x4WM6ZLkN1kal/view?usp=sharing)
- Short talk at the 4th Data Science in Astronomy Conference held at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo (October 3 - 5, 2022) [Slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eCxuSCMEshO7sUaviOSEWU8hxl2yHAMQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106418298605170918085&rtpof=true&sd=true)
